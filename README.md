# HackNITR 2020
For the "HackNITR" Hackathon 2020

# Rush Hour

Our project is from the track - "Smart Cities". It is a traffic management project, incorporating the fields of Machine Learning, Web Development and App Development. At each traffic signal, for each side, it counts the number of cars, scooters, buses, etc., and then assigns a corresponding priority and time for that particular signal, instead of just assigning a fixed time to all irrespective of the number of vehicles present at that time. Thus, this will save time of the commuters. Also, our project contains a special feature for ambulances, fire-fighters and other emergency-response teams to mark in their location of their starting and destination points and according to it, algorithms of all the traffic signals along that way will be altered in a certain way, allowing the emergency vehicles to pass the signal without any stopping at the signal.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get anyone a copy of the project up and running on his/her local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This contains a list of things a person needs before-hand to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

This contains a step by step series of examples that tell anyone how to get a development environment running.

```
Steps:
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Running the tests

This explains how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
